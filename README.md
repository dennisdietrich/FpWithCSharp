## Presentation title
So you think you know functions: An introduction to functional programming with C#

## Description
All functions are equal.
But some functions are more equal than others!
They could be higher-order functions or (im)pure.
Some might be closures.
In this talk you'll learn what all of these terms mean, how they relate to functional programming, and how functional programming lets you solve certain problems more elegantly and succinctly than object-oriented programming, using (simplified) real-world examples in C#.
